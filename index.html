          <h4><span class="show-when-wide">Introduction</span></h4>

          <p>This site is a <u>simulation</u> of a personal blogging site, used for experimentation and learning with
            basic html, css and 'responsive' layouts for the Udacity 'Front End Web Developer' nanodegree
            programme.</p>

          <p>On this, the 'home' page, a 'flex flow' setting of 'row wrap' is used to reorganise the 'card'
            based links to the various blog etries into a gallery.</p>

          <p>On the blog pages themselves, a media query is used to turn the horizontal, in line, navigation
            section into a sidebar, by switching the flex flow from <b>row</b> to <b>column.</b></p>

          <p>And there are some simple tweaks to make things look better on mobile devices, based on
            the device pixel ratio.</p>

          <p>Of course, I missed some things that were in the <u>project rubric</u> on my first submission, inlcuding
            this:</p>

          <blockquote>"You have to include &lt;b&gt; for bold, and &lt;u&gt; for underline properties inside your paragraph tag
            and also include &lt;blockquote&gt; in your project."</blockquote>

          <p>Which is itself good practice in finding out how to quote html tags on an html page!</p>

                  <h4>@imports, 'alts' and maybe ...</h4>

                  <p> ... it would be handy to have <b>an indication of browser window width</b> just to
                    see how well layouts and stuff would work on various devices. Javascript would
                    be one way to do this, but we're not meant to be doing that yet. However, having
                    used screen width media queries to modify button content yesterday, it occurs
                    to me the same trick/kludge could be used for screen widths.</p>

                  <p>Of course <u>an ugly way to do it</u> would be to overlay tansparent bordered
                    rectangles indicating various screen sizes over everything. <b>A bit yuk!</b></p>

                  <p>Other things to clean up:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Styling of lists!!</li>
                    <li>'alts' for missing images</li>
                    <li>The title on the home page, which has gone weird</li>
                    <Li>css imports and unused commented out bits</Li>
                    <li>Better handling of css changes between index page and blog pages</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>It's kind of a <u>left-over from yesterday</u> and there seem to be lots of ways to do navigation
                    buttons. In the context of this exercise, it should be <b>'pure html'</b> if possible. So, no
                    Javascript (at this stage) and prefereably without the complication of html forms.</p>

                  <p>And then maybe start to think about putting the <b>navigation into sidebars</b> (i.e. doing
                    responsive layots) when the display window gets wider.</p>

                  <p>Apart from adding a bit more <b>content</b>, which is really optional as it could be faked, today
                    is a day for <b>sorting out the blog entries page:</b></p>

                  <h4>Hmm, actually it's really a commercial one ...</h4>

                  <p>Even on this side of the Atlantic, where we have <b>plenty of problems of our own</b> going on, one of the big
                    news items is Mr. Trump being permanently removed from Twitter. However, for 'technology' I don't think
                    that is the really big news ...</p>
                  <p>As everone's thoughts turned to where Mr. Trump might go next for an effective mouthpiece, attention
                    turned to a lesser known platform called 'Parler'; one with a reputation for being popular among those
                    with right-wing political views.</p>
                  <p>Now, there's a bit of conjecture in what follows, as I'm not party to the legal contracts, but if the
                    mainstream news is accurate, <u>not only is the 'Parler' app being removed from the Apple and Google stores
                    but Amazon is de-platforming Parler</u></p>
                  <p>So, here's my assumption. Amazon retain the power to 'de-platform' anyone they don't like. Yes,
                    certainly, there will have to be a justification for doing so and whether you agree with that or not, in the
                    case of Parler, is not my point. I'm asking myself, 'How many businesses today (10th January 2021) are
                    <b><em>totally</em></b> dependent of Amazon for their continuing day-to-day function? And how are they protected
                    from being 'de-platformed'?</p>
                  <p>More prescient, perhaps, is the question what might happen if the ownership of Amazon (or the relevant
                    part of Amazon) changed ownership? These things are allowed in a free marker, capitalist world. If would
                    business is 'Cloud dependent' how secure is it against such events turning sour?</p>
                  <p>But that would never happen wth such a significant piece of technology I hear many people cry. What
                    about ARM? Hugely significant in the world technology stakes, something that might be considered economically
                    significant for the UK. Effective control sold first to Softbank and, I believe, subsequently to nVidia.
                    Not that I have any qualms about Softbank or nVidia, my thoughts are simply turning to the fact that you
                    have no knowledge of, or control over, the future ownership of the critical foundatins of your 'Cloud'
                    business.</p>
                  <p>Food for thought, or <b>am I just being techno-paranoid?</b></p>

                  <h4>Well perhaps just this Friday ...</h4>

                  <p> ... and just on the creative writing front. Well, it is Friday morning, still <b>dark and it's very cold</b> in the U.K.
                  at the moment.</p>

                  <P>On the blog project front, things are a bit more clear and I do have some objectives.</P>

                  <p>I'm going to make the listing of blog pages on the index page a bit more <u>exiting</u>. At the moment it's just
                  an unordered list of links ... very old-school html. I'm going to make the section a flex container, containing
                  other flex containers (or maybe grid containers), each of which will have a small image, a blog page title and
                  a date. I'm not sure yet which of those will have the hyperlink ... or perhaps the whole container will.
                  Something for exploration.</p>

                  <p>The other, probably small thing, is to start to play with <u>responisve layouts</u>. I think, initially, I'm just
                  going to play with those two underlines below the footer. As the page gets wider they could leave more space
                  between the ends of the underline and the edges of the page. It could use multiple breakpoints so that there's
                  a less obvious 'pop' if you're resizing a window. Probably not something I'd do in a commercial design (does
                  it pay for itself?) but something that I think will be good for exploring the technology. Let's see.</p>

                  <p>I'll need to tidy up a few images too.</p>

                  <p>Hmm, I guess this has been a kind of daily stand-up with my team!</p>

                  <h4>And it's not even a full moon ...</h4>

                  <p>This morning there was a wonderful looking moon in the sky ... not quite a half-moon but more than a crescent. So, I went out in the cold garden to try to get today's blog selfie. These things never look as impressive in a picture as they do to your eyes.</p>

                  <p>Still, being out in the cold for a bit might have given my immune system a beneficial bit of cold shock. I was watching a documentary last night on how to care for your immune system and it seems that a daily bit of cold really does gives you an immunity boost.</p>

                  <p>Which, of course, makes me think <b>how trivial all this (including nanodegrees) is when compared with the raging Covid statistics in the U.K.</b>, the struggles and the bravery of the Health Srvice and also, well, shall I just say ... what's going on in the U.S.A.</p>

                  <p>Still, I should have some <u>objectives for today</u> and they are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Practice with flex elements to centre text in a contianer and investigates how it behaves when you resize.</li>
                    <li>Use flex to arrange a list of links to multiple blog pages.</li>
                    <li>Sort out some images to use in these sample pages.</li>
                    <li>Get some links working between pages, it saves a lot of fiddling about</li>
                    <li>There's more, I'm sure, that will emerge in the wash.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>Two things to <b>start</b> today ...</h4>

                  <P>So, two new things today ... the first id starting the <b>Udacity Front End Web Developer</b> project ... and the second is that   today I should have been getting my hair cut, from here on in, it's unknown territory: pony tails, bun, braids or just a headband? Mind you a headband might force me back into 1980s style coding and that's definitely <b><em>not</em></b> the objective here.</P>

                  <p>And, talking of objectives, today is the day to rememeber to <u><i>read the question</i></u> or as Udacity are calling it the <i> project rubruc</i>.</p>

                  <p>Let's go!</p>

                  <h4>Lessons done ... now what?</h4>

                  <p><em>OK ... Lessons done, time to gear up for the project</em></p>

                  <p>So, this morning I finished the final lesson of <b>Part 2</b> of the course, the 'Creating Responive Layouts' section.
                    I had a bit of a hiccup with one of the  exercises that didn't seem to work online, so I copied it and pasted it
                    into 'Sublime' and finished it offline. On reflection, <b>it seems likely that I may have messed it up</b> with some
                    invalid syntax in the online editing tool. Hmm, maybe it was my fault.</p>

                  <p>Anyway, time to think about the project that goes with this section of the course, so here I am recording a
                    few thoughts each day that might form the basis for some form of a blog.</p>

                  <p>Oh, and a took a selfie! Given that the U.K. has just gone back into <u>national lockdown</u> and I was due
                    to get a haircut this week, maybe the progression of Covid hair might provide some images for a blog.</p>

                  <p>It's getting shaggy, but still feeling OK at the moment. I don't think that's going to last though!</p>
