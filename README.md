## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## A Plan

Rather than just use the supplied index page, things might be more interesting if I carry forward the 'Blog' project but keep all the blog entries on the index page and use Javascript to index them.

### Set Up the Index Page

The first stage then is to construct the index page ...

 * Use the Personal Blog index page to give you a 'wireframe
 * Clean up the CSS which was all a bit messy on the blog project (as advised by the marker)
 * Import the blog entries to the index page as bigger cards, replacing the existing 'navigation cards'
 * ... in a column, giving a long scrollable page
 * Add a very simple script to do something on the page

### Decide which events will generate rsponses from the page

 * Scroll can initially change the backgroud colours, for example
 * Work thru' the rubric making sure that you're supporting all the required events

### Now apply the events to the DOM to make things pretty


### Stretch .. make a JS sort on forward or backward date order control!
